This directory is where you should put any "scratchpad" files that you
want to keep around, but don't want to actually commit to the repository.
For example, notes-to-self-about-that-difficult-bug.txt could go here.
Because the whole directory is included in .gitignore, anything in here
will be ignored by default, and won't clutter up your "git status" output.
